#Brastel Remit responsive prototype (2013)

##Context
I was in charge of brastelremit.jp web site (an internatonal money transfer service) I made a proposal to make the web site mobile-friendly (Read more about the making-of this project here)

##What I did
I made a prototype of a mobile-friendly web, using "Responsive design" concepts: one website that suits all shapes, sizes and interaction. Depending on the device screen, the same page behaves differently.

##Technologies
+ Bootstrap : a set of HTML5 components perfect for creating responsive web sites
+ Docpad : a site generator built on top of node.js
+ CoffeeScript/CoffeeKup : the templating language used to create pages
