                <p>Brastel Remit offers two methods of transfer request to best suit your needs.</p>
                <h4>Easy Transfer</h4>
                <p class="with-margin">Easy Transfer is the ideal method if you will be sending funds regularly to a specific recipient. You may associate the recipient to an exclusive bank account for deposits, allowing faster transfers without the need of placing a request every time.<br>Any amount you deposit to the account will be automatically processed and sent to the associated recipient. With Easy Transfer you may register up to 5 recipients.</p>
                <p class="with-margin">For example, if you are sending ¥30,000 to your grandmother, and ¥50,000 to your mother, the transfer fee will be deducted from each amount deposited in the associated account:</p>
